•	Purpose: Website that bookmarks pages visited while providing the user the ability to take notes of the link location and categorize them. Additional feature will be to create a Browser Extension that has the user login and takes notes/adds URL on the spot.

•	Front-end Features:
  	User login (also may be required if we create a Browser Extension for the site) o	Bootstrap for styling o	Search feature -     to look for keywords in the notes or URL.
	  Add feature – to add URL, name, category, notes, (possibly area to upload screenshot). 
	  Display EVERYTHING on main page – sort by category or name. 
	  Navigation / Logo / Footer

•	Backend needs: I will be adding backend features at a later time, using firebase.

•	Tools / Languages used:	HTML, CSS, JavaScript,jQuery,  Bootstrap 4 Beta, GitHub.
